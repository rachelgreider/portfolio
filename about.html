                <p class="videotext2" >Hi! <br>

                    I’m Rachel.<br> <br>
                    
                    For the last year, I have been learning about motion design, photography, and website design. I’d like to learn more about these in particular as well as all aspects of design at my next co-op. 
                    
                    <br><br>At my last co-op, I was the only designer. This was a phenomenal experience because I found that I can teach myself almost anything I want to learn but I also found that I miss working with other designers. In my next job, I would love to work on a team with designers doing work the I aspire to do.
                    
                    <br><br>In my three years at DAAP and my two co-op semesters so far, I have found that I need my work to mean something. I’m a relatively quiet person, so I want to advocate for the things I believe in through my work. </p>
